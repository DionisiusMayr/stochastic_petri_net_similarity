# Stochastic Petri net similarity

This repository contains an implementation of the method proposed in my master thesis to compute the behavioral similarity between two stochastic Petri nets.

## Requirements

The only requirement is `pm4py`.

For reproducibility reasons, a `requirements.txt` file containing all the specific versions used and tested is provided, but normally a simple `pip install pm4py` should suffice.

## Example

In the file `example_1.py` there is an example usage of the similarity computation.
